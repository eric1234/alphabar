= FAIR WARNING

This plugin/gem was mostly written in the early 1.0 days. Upgraded to
1.2 as some point. Just recently updated to 2.3.8 although in the
process the old testing code was too crufty to upgrade so I just dropped
it completely.

So it has some experience but the upgrade cycles (especially the recent
one to 2.3.8) might have introduced some bugs. Without good testing
we don't know.

Tasks for a future project:

* Implement testing again
* Make it run on the Rails 3 code that came out just a few days ago
